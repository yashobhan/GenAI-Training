The drinks are amazing- every last one of them- but the margaritas are the best I've ever had.  They tasted like a fresh squeeze of sunshine that makes me happy inside.  Margarita Mondays- $4 margs AND free food?  Happy hours are amazing.  New Year's Eve last year was amazing.  The 1 year anniversary party was amazing.
